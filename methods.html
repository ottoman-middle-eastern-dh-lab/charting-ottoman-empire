    <h1>Methodology</h1>

    <p>Our project follows a structured, iterative workflow that integrates Ottoman historical research 
    with digital humanities and data science. The initial stages—decoding, transliterating, 
    translating, and summarizing the corpus—have laid the foundation for structuring and 
    analyzing the data. Below, we outline the key steps of our methodology:</p>

    <h2>1. Decoding and Transliteration</h2>

    <p>The first step in our workflow involves deciphering and transliterating Ottoman fiscal and 
    administrative documents, which often contain shorthand, abbreviations, and specialized 
    terminology. Our team carefully converts the Persian-Arabic script into a Latin alphabet 
    format, ensuring consistency across documents. This process requires deep expertise in 
    paleography, codicology, and archival research to accurately interpret handwritten 
    variations, marginal notes, and numerical systems.</p>

    <p>This transliteration is essential for making the texts readable, searchable, and analyzable, 
    paving the way for further processing, including data extraction and AI-assisted translation.</p>

    <p>To enhance efficiency, we employ supervised machine-learning models for Named Entity 
    Recognition (NER), which help classify people, places, institutions, and key financial terms 
    within the documents. This automated approach supports large-scale text analysis while 
    maintaining accuracy through human validation.</p>

    <h2>2. Translation and Summarization</h2>

    <p>Once the documents are transliterated, they are translated and summarized to make their 
    contents accessible to a broader audience. Given the complexity of Ottoman administrative 
    language, which often includes formulaic expressions, legal jargon, and archaic 
    terminology, we use a hybrid approach:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Expert human translation</strong> ensures accuracy, particularly for ambiguous or 
        context-dependent phrases.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-assisted translation tools</strong> help speed up the process, with outputs carefully 
        reviewed and refined by historians.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Summaries are then created to highlight key information such as transaction details, financial 
    records, and political decisions recorded in the documents. These summaries serve as 
    structured data points, allowing us to link and analyze patterns across different sources.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Modeling and Structuring</h2>

    <p>After translation, the extracted data undergoes a rigorous modeling and structuring process 
    to ensure consistency and usability. Each entry is enriched with metadata, including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Dates, recorded in both the Ottoman fiscal calendar and their Gregorian equivalents.</li>
        <li>Geographical references, linked to historical maps and modern coordinates.</li>
        <li>Named entities, such as individuals, institutions, and administrative units.</li>
        <li>Financial transactions, documenting revenues, expenses, and broader economic 
        trends.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To efficiently manage this structured dataset, we are developing a relational database in SQL, 
    which allows for complex queries, cross-referencing, and visualization of financial and 
    administrative records. This database serves as the foundation for network analysis and 
    statistical modeling of the Ottoman fiscal system.</p>

    <h2>4. SQL Querying and Visualization</h2>

    <p>Once structured, the data is stored in our relational SQL database, enabling:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Searchable text archives for exploring transliterated and translated documents.</li>
        <li>Interactive tables that allow users to dynamically analyze financial and administrative 
        data.</li>
        <li>Network visualizations, illustrating relationships between individuals, institutions, and 
        transactions.</li>
        <li>Interconnected datasets, linking documents based on people, locations, and 
        financial activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This stage ensures that the data is accessible, reusable, and preserved for long-term 
    research. The database is designed to capture the hierarchical and relational nature of 
    Ottoman financial records, facilitating collaborative research and advanced analysis.</p>

    <h2>5. Network Analysis</h2>

    <p>A key innovation of this project is the application of digital humanities tools to construct 
    network visualizations that reveal the complex relationships within the Ottoman fiscal 
    system. We transfer data from MySQL to Gephi to build interactive network graphs, which 
    illustrate:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Social and administrative connections among key figures in the Ottoman financial 
        bureaucracy.</li>
        <li>Economic flows and transaction patterns across different regions and institutions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To enhance our analysis, we also integrate the data into a Neo4j graph database, enabling 
    dynamic exploration of relationships between individuals, assets, and state transactions. This 
    approach provides a deeper understanding of the structural and functional dynamics of 
    Ottoman financial networks.</p>

    <h2>6. Interpretation and Research Applications</h2>

    <p>The final step in this phase involves interpreting the structured data within broader historical 
    contexts. Our interdisciplinary approach—combining Ottoman history, economic history, and 
    digital humanities—enables new insights into governance, taxation, and social structures. This 
    stage also sets the foundation for future expansions, including the integration of additional 
    archival sources and collaborative research initiatives.</p>
