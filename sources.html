    <h1>Sources</h1>

    <p>Our research is based on Ottoman fiscal and administrative documents preserved in the 
    Directorate of State Archives, Istanbul, and other archival collections. These records provide 
    detailed insights into the economic, legal, and social structures of the Ottoman Empire from 
    the early 1700s to the 1840s.</p>

    <p>We focus on three key document sets that serve as the foundation for our analysis. Additionally, 
    we are developing a comprehensive catalog of over 1,721 fiscal codices, many of which remain 
    unsummarized.</p>

    <h2>Core Document Sets</h2>

    <h3>Codex MAD9748 (1796–1800)</h3>
    <p><strong>[Visual: mad9748]</strong></p>
    <p>Codex MAD9748 contains 2,125 imperial decrees spread across 384 pages, detailing the 
    assets, debts, and financial transactions of 1,849 notable individuals who died in the 
    1790s. The codex offers semi-narrative accounts that document state decisions on 
    post-mortem wealth redistribution during the early Ottoman reform period (New Order). 
    These records provide valuable insights into:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>State intervention in wealth transfers.</li>
        <li>Credit and debt relations among elites.</li>
        <li>The financial obligations of the deceased and their impact on surviving communities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Codex MAD9726 (1760s–1790s)</h3>
    <p><strong>[Visual: mad9726]</strong></p>
    <p>Codex MAD9726 is a highly complex Ottoman fiscal register containing shorthand 
    annotations and intricate paratextual elements. This document set is essential for 
    understanding:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ottoman financial administration and revenue management.</li>
        <li>State debt collection practices and legal frameworks.</li>
        <li>The broader economic networks that connected merchants, tax farmers, and state officials.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our team has worked extensively on decoding, transliterating, and structuring this codex to 
    make its data accessible for computational analysis.</p>

    <h3>The Ali Pasha Collections</h3>

    <p>The Ali Pasha Collections consist of two separate sets of documents, offering a unique 
    perspective on regional governance and economic relations in the late Ottoman period:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Ali Pasha Archive (Greek Collection):</strong> Preserved in the Gennadius Library, 
        Athens, this archive contains nearly 1,500 documents, including correspondence, 
        financial agreements, and debt records from Ali Pasha’s administration. The texts are 
        written in Greek script, often incorporating Ottoman Turkish, Persian, Arabic, 
        Albanian, Vlach, French, and Italian words. <strong>[Visuals: alipasha1 and alipasha2]</strong></li>

        <li><strong>Ottoman Archival Documents on Ali Pasha:</strong> These materials, collected from the 
        Ottoman Archives in Istanbul, detail Ali Pasha’s financial transactions, political 
        negotiations, and interactions with Ottoman imperial authorities. <strong>[Visual: alipasha3]</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Together, these documents shed light on Ali Pasha’s governance strategies, military 
    financing, and regional economic networks.</p>

    <h2>Cataloging 1,721 Ottoman Fiscal Codices</h2>

    <p>Beyond these three key document sets, our project is developing a comprehensive catalog of 
    1,721 Ottoman fiscal codices spanning the 18th and 19th centuries. These codices contain 
    an estimated 3.5 million entries, covering:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Probate inventories of deceased individuals.</li>
        <li>Imperial decrees related to estate management.</li>
        <li>Auction records and tax registers documenting economic transactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While many individual documents have brief digital summaries, the codices themselves 
    remain largely unstructured and unanalyzed. Our goal is to create a searchable, structured 
    dataset that integrates GIS-based maps, chronological diagrams, and a directory of 
    notable figures, making these sources more accessible for researchers.</p>
